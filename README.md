# Ludum Dare 50
Okay, okay. I've tried to do a few Ludum Dare in the recent past, but have always fallen short (except for two around the late 30's). I've got to remember to keep the scope small and get something vaguely game shaped.

I don't have an engine right now, just a bunch of dependencies. I've pre-added things I think I'll want to the Cargo.toml which is probably not cheating. People setup scene transitions and stuff, this has to be fine! I'm not really in it for the competitive aspect, anyway, so if I get like, disqualified I won't have really lost anything.

I've done my first ["I'm In" post](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/$279969/im-in) for some reason. It echos a lot of what's here. I think I'll use this readme as a sort of project log. I don't really feel like tweeting it and I'm not sure where it would fit in the [wikarden](https://nyble.dev/garden/home.html). It's my website, I could find space, but I think I'll just write a retrospective later, maybe.
